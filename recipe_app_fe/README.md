# Recipe App Be (Rails)

## Overview

This project is a proof-of-concept frontend built with **Vite 6.0.6** and **React 18.3.1**. It consumes the backend Rails API to deliver recipes generated by an external LLM. The user inputs ingredients and diet type, and the frontend displays the resulting recipes.

## Project Description

- Purpose: Demonstrate how a React-based web service can interact with a Rails API, which in turn uses an LLM for recipe generation.
- Functionality:

1. Collects user input (ingredients, diet type).
2. Sends requests to the backend to fetch generated recipes.
3. Displays the recipes in a user-friendly manner.

- Availability: Runs locally at http://localhost:5173. \
  Currently only runs locally; not deployed to production.
